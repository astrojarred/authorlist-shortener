# authorlist-shortener
A script that takes a bibtex file as input and reduces the author lists to a max number and automatically adds an 'et al.'



### Installation

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/astrojarred/authorlist-shortener` and that's it!

### Usage

Use with the following:

`python authorlist-shortener.py "/path/to/bibliofile.bib" integer_max_authors`

which produces a file named `bibliofile_max<integer_max_authors>authors.bib`

For example:

`python authorlist-shortener.py "bibliofile.bib" 5` will reduce any author lists contained in `bibliofile.bib` to 5, replacing all author lists after the first with "and others". This will appear as "Author, Fist et al." under most circumstances.

### Requirements

1. bibtexparser to automatically turn the bibtex file into a dict (can use `pip install bibtexparser`)
2. ntpath to automatically split filepath and filenames across systems
3. sys to accept inputs from terminal

### Notes

1. This was tested with and designed for the automatic bibtex entries generated by ADS
2. If it raises a UndefinedString error, probably you have an entry or entries that aren't contained in quotes or curly brackets (often months and years)
